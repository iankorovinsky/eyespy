# Eye Spy

This navigation device and lifestyle companion app for the visually impaired were
designed to help the blind navigate unknown spaces. Encased in PVC hospital fabric, the
device attaches to the user's hand, and the app can be operated using Android-integrated
accessibility features. This creation was designed to help the blind navigate spaces by following
the prototype's auditory and vibratory cues. By employing the app, they could keep track of their
live location and fitness statistics. To test this project, we conducted a simulated research study
and wrote an academic paper to document our findings officially. While publishing the paper in
an academic journal is still a work in process, the report will be published on ResearchGate in
January 2023
