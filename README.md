This navigation device and lifestyle companion app for the visually impaired were designed to help the blind navigate unknown spaces. Encased in PVC hospital fabric, the device attaches to the user's hand, and the app can be operated using Android-integrated accessibility features. This creation was designed to help the blind navigate spaces by following the prototype's auditory and vibratory cues. By employing the app, they could keep track of their live location and fitness statistics. To test this project, we conducted a simulated research study and wrote an academic paper to document our findings officially. The official report for this was published on ResearchGate in January 2023.
